# Invisible-cloak
In this project we convert the frame to a hsv frame and select a color of our choice and find its hsv ranges and make that particular coloured object coincide with the background 
which is read for a very less time in the beginning, That's All! when ever u bring an object of the particular color selected it cant be seen! Hurray!
